    <h1>Maynooth University - Dr Inventor Files (D3.1)</h1>
    <h2>ROS Assessment Tool Prototype for Deliverable (D3.1)</h2>

    <h2>Name</h2>
    ROS Assessment Tool - Assesses the quality of the  Research objects.
    At the current stage the tool uses xml files of the ROS. These xml files are generated by pdfx.
    To test the tool, please download the xml 40/80 paper xml dataset from <a href="http://ccgv.org.uk/issues/93"> redmine </a> and extract it to your preferred folder.
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ol>
    <li>You should have Mysql up and running on your local machine. You need to have access to create a new database and should be able to run it on the local host. </li>
    <li>You should have Scopus API Key. If your institution is a subscriber of this service, you can directly request for the API key </li>
    <li>Java jdk 1.6 or latest version installed and running on your machine </li>

</ol>
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>Option 1: running the application using the jar files</h3>
Steps:
<ol>
    <li>download the jar file from <a href="ROSAT JAR.zip">ROSAT JAR </a>.  This file contains the jar file and all the associated dependent files and libraries. </li>
    <li>Extract the ROSAT.Zip to your preferred location.</li>
    <li>Open the file config.xml file with your preferred editor. Make sure that the config.xml file is located in the same folder where the jar files and lib files are stored</li>
    <li>Enter your preferred settings for each of the entries 
        <ol>
            <li>ros_repository_location is the folder where the xml dataset is stored</li>
            <li>citation_data_location. The location of the initial data where you store the downloaded sjr and jcr. If you don't have these data set, please use the default location.</li>
            <li>ros_qa_output_location is the folder where the resulting csv and arff files will be stored</li>
            <li>scopus_api. Put your Scopus api here </li>
            <li>db_name. Put your preferred database name here. Default name is DrInventor </li>
            <li>db_user_name. Put your database username here. Default user is root. </li>
            <li>db_pass_word. Put your preferred database password here. Default name is ""(empty string) </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>On your command prompt go to the folder you extract the zip file and type:<br> <b> <kbd>java -cp rosat.jar ie.nuim.cs.dri.repository.Repository</kbd></b><br>
        The Program will create the database, create all the required tables and populate them with the required data. This may take for a while.
    </li>
    <li> On your command prompt type:<br><b> <kbd>java -cp rosat.jar ie.nuim.cs.dri.metadata.MetadataExtractor</kbd></b> <br> The program will read the research objects form the repository location and collect citation data 
        from Scopus and other sources and store the results as csv and arff format under the ros_qa_output_location</li>
</ol>
<h3>Option 2: running the application from the source file using NetBeans</h3>
Steps:
<ol>
    <li>Download the source file from <a href="ROSAT SOURCE.zip">ROSAT Source</a>. </li>
    <li>Extract the ROSAT.Zip to your preferred location. Open the file config.xml file with your preferred editor. Make sure that the config.xml file is located in the same folder where the src files are stored </li>
    <li>Enter your preferred settings for each of the entries
        <ol>
            <li>ros_repository_location is the folder where the xml version of the RO is stored</li>
            <li>citation_data_location. The location of the initial data where you store the downloaded sjr and jcr. If you don't have this data set, please use the default location.</li>
            <li>ros_qa_output_location is the folder where the resulting csv and arff files will be stored</li>
            <li>scopus_api. Put your Scopus api here </li>
             <li>db_name. Put your preferred database name here. Default name is DrInventor </li>
            <li>db_user_name. Put your database username here. Default user is root. </li>
            <li>db_pass_word. Put your preferred database password here. Default name is ""(empty string) </li>
            
        </ol>

    <li>Under the ie.nuim.cs.dri.repository package, run the Repository.java    </li>
    <li>Under the ie.nuim.cs.dri.metadata package, run the MetadataExtractor.java file   </li>
</ol>

<h3> How to report bugs</h3>
This is an initial implementation of the ROS assessment tool and by no means is complete. We expect more comments and bug reports from other groups. Please report any bug or forward your questions to <b><i>abgaz.yalemisew@nuim.ie</i></b> or report it on redmine.
